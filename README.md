# Library-system-using-C
a Simple library system college project that I decided to spice things up in

Our project is a library system that stores for each book the title, the author, publisher , ISBN , date of publications , number of copies , current available number of copies and categories.
Also our project stores membersâ€™ first and last name , ID , address , phone number , age and e-mail.

It also stores the borrowing information like the date borrowed, date due to return and date returned.

It includes  six menus including : 
1-Book management.
2-member Management.
3-Borrow Management.
4-administrative actions.
5-print books , members or borrows.
6-save changes.
7-Exit
